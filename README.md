# Example Data Science Projects for Nutritional Sciences Students Using NHANES
NHANES (the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) is a national, publically available data source on dietary behavior in the United States. The projects in this reposititory present examples of how NHANES data can be used to help students learn and/or gain exposure to basic programming skills in Python. 
Nutritional Sciences and other health behavior instructors could also use on of the code programe to generate case studies for 24-hour recalls for students to use in class. 

# Datasets and updating file paths
Due to the large file sizes, individuals who are interested in replicating and extending these projects will need to download the files directly from the NHANES website: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/. The file paths will need to be updated in all Jupytr notebooks prior to running or modifying the code. 

# Contributors and Grant Acknowledgment 
The code in these notebooks was initially created by Soumyadeep Ray, MS in collaboration with the project mentor and subject matter expert, Allison Hepworth, PhD at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, OK. This project was funded by a South Big Data Innovation Hub SEEDS award awarded to Allison Hepworth. The South Big Data Innovation Hub is supported by the National Science Foundation through awards: #1550305 and 191658.
