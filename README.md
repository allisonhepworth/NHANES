# NHANES: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
NHANES is a national, publically available data source on dietary behavior in the United States. The projects in this reposititory present examples of how NHANES data can be used to help students learn and/or gain exposure to basic programming skills in Python. 
Nutritional Sciences and other health behavior instructors could also use this tool to generate case studies for 24-hour recalls for students to use in class. 
The code in these notebooks was initially created by Soumyadeep Ray, MS in collaboration with the project mentor and subject matter expert, Allison Hepworth, PhD at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, OK. 
This project was funded by a South Big Data Innovation Hub SEEDS award awarded to Allison Hepworth. The South Big Data Innovation Hub is supported by the
National Science Foundation through awards:#1550305 and 191658.
